# FlightController

This repository contains some tiny code to emulate a Joystick / Gamepad with an Arduino Micro. Various input devices (rotary encoder, buttons, potentiometers, IMU) get mapped to joystick axes / buttons. The original purpose is to support simple DIY flight yokes. But it should be possible to adjust for anything really.
